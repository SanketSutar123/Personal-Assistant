Program Instructions:

This program is a voice-activated personal assistant that performs the following tasks:
1. Speak "Time" to know the current time:
   - The assistant will speak out the current time in HH:MM AM/PM format.

2. Speak "News" to know the top 5 latest news:
   - The assistant fetches the top 5 news headlines using a News API. 
   - To activate this feature, go to "https://newsapi.org/" and get your API key.
   - Paste the API key in the `News_Api_Key` variable at Line 12.

3. Speak "Reminder" to set a reminder:
   - The assistant will prompt you for the reminder name and time.
   - Enter the time in the command line in HH:MM format (24-hour format).
   - At the specified time, the reminder will be spoken aloud.

4. Speak "Exit" to end the program:
   - The program will terminate upon hearing this command.

Setup Instructions:
1. API Keys:
   - Weather API Key: Get your API key from "https://openweathermap.org/" and paste it in the `Weather_Api_Key` variable at Line 11.
   - News API Key: Get your API key from "https://newsapi.org/" and paste it in the `News_Api_Key` variable at Line 12.

2. Install Required Modules:
   Run the following command in your terminal to install the required Python modules:
   Command: pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests

Note: This program uses free APIs for fetching weather and news. Make sure your API keys are valid and active.
